# GPUI Tools Documentation

[GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs/) pattern docs & examples for agents & humans.

## Contributing

Contributions to this documentation are welcome! Please submit PRs with fixes or new patterns.

- Attribute direct examples from _fully open source_ projects – don't include examples from non-permissively licensed code.
- Patterns from less-permissive licenses should be re-written in your own words/code.
- Keep examples in documents terse and focused on the pattern being illustrated.

What we need:

- A review pass through all existing docs
- More coverage (styling, interaction, data flow)
- A real rust project for adding testable examples (ideally, in the future the docs would only include runnable, testable examples)
